## Install

To install all dependencies needed for the project, run:

```
pip install -R requirements.txt
```

## Testing

To run the test framework, simply run `python3 test.py`.

## Local installation
** Create a virtual environment **
`virutalenv virtenv`

** Activate the virtual environment**
`source virtenv/bin/activate`

** Install all flask dependencies**
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you can run the application inside the virtual environment using: `python run.py`. 

You have to activate the environment in every session you want to run code inside the environment. To return to the global environment deactivate the virtual environment.

** Deactivate the environment**
`deactivate`


If you do not want to source the environment you can use paths to **pip** and **python**.
`virtenv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` **and** `virtenv/bin/python3 run.py`
